# PowerShell Scripts Collection
> This is a collection of small (dirty) scripts for PowerShell. By dirty, it means there isn't always functions, arrays, CmdletBinding  
> or loops. Just a simple one line command to get your job done. Some very common use commands to a little more complex scripts. A little
> something for all.

>If you're looking for properly written scripts, this is not the place.
